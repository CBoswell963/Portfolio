# Portfolio
Caleb Boswell Portfolio

Hello, this is my Github portfolio where I store the projects I have worked on.  Among the projects are my senior design project from NC State and some practice programs from when I was learning the basic of Data Analysis and the related tools.
My most recent posts to the repository are some new projects I have been challenging myself to make to not only showcase my skills to potential employers, but to help me build my skills even further.  I am currently focusing on maing projects that cater to my interests, mainly Pokemon and games,
since they are easier for me to focus on in my own time.  With that said, that is hardly the only type of projects I can make if requested.  

While I began programming because I was pursuing a career in making games, once I began making my first programs, I began to love the entire process of coding.  It was as if coding was one big puzzle game to me.  Trying to figure out the algorithms to accomplish the task,
working through how the code fits together to turn the algorithms into a working program, and looking back over the code if, or more often than not when, something goes wrong to find where the problem is and how to fix it.  Coding is something I love to do
and I plan to keep working on projects and expanding my portfolio going forward.  I hope you enjoy my work, because I enjoyed making them.

If you want to try out some of the projects I have made, I have added links to them in my LinkedIn profile below.
