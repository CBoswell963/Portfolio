PokemonEncounterSimulator Description

When users open the application, they are directed to the home screen.  From there they can choose to go to the encounter page or to the caught Pokemon page.

When the user selects the Encounter Pokemon button, they are redirected to the Encounter page, where they will be presented with four buttons and a message telling them to select an environment.
The buttons the user can select from are "Mountain", "River", "Plains" and a "Home" button, the last of which will redirect the user back to the main page.
The user can then select one of the three environment buttons to try and encounter a Pokemon, with each environment allowing them to encounter two set Pokemon that are only available in that environment.
When the user selects one of the encounter buttons, a message will display based on the results of the attempt.  Either a message will appear saying no Pokemon were encountered, or a random Pokemon from
that environment's Pokemon list will have its image displayed along with a message saying the user encountered said Pokemon.

When the user encounters a Pokemon, a new button will display that prompts the user to try and catch the Pokemon.  The user has the option of ignoring this and selecting another encounter button or returning to home.
If they choose to try and catch the Pokemon one of two things will occur.  Either the catch is successful and the Pokemon is caught and added to the user's caught Pokemon list with a message saying the Pokemon was caught,
or the user fails to catch the Pokemon and a message displays the Pokemon broke free.  If the Pokemon broke free another message is shown saying what attempt that catch was out of three.  The user can then try to catch the
Pokemon again or they can choose one of the other buttons to either try and encounter a new Pokemon or return to the home page.  If they try and catch the Pokemon again they will have two more attempts to successfully catch
the Pokemon.  On the third attempt, if the user failed to catch the Pokemon a message will display saying the Pokemon broke free and then fled, preventing the user from any more attempts.  If the user has caught the Pokemon
or the Pokemon has fled, the encounter screen will then revert to its default state after a few seconds.  If the user attempts to encounter Pokemon by pressing an encounter button before the page resets, even if they encounter
a Pokemon the page will still be reset,so it is recommended the user waits for the reset before trying to encounter more Pokemon, although if they choose to return to home they will be redirected to the home page without issue.
The user can hold up to 100 caught Pokemon.  If the user has reached that limit the catch button will be disabled and a message will request the user to release a Pokemon before trying to catch more.

Back at the home screen, if the user selects the Caught Pokemon button, they will be directed to the Caught Pokemon page.  This page will show a list of all Pokemon caught in the app by displaying the Pokemon's name,
a Release button next to their name, and a Home button at the bottom of the page that will redirect the user back to the Home Screen.
The user can then select a Pokemon's name on the list and they will be directed to the Pokemon's details page.  This page will display the Pokemon's name at the top with a sprite of the Pokemon below the name.
It will also show further details of the Pokemon including its Type/s, its height in meters and its weight in kilograms, with a button at the bottom of it all called "Back to Caught Pokemon" which 
will redirect the user back to the Caught Pokemon page.  On the Caught Pokemon page the user can select the release button next to a Pokemon to choose to release it.  If they press this button, a window will pop up asking
the user if they are sure they want to release said Pokemon.  If the user selects cancel from the window, then nothing happens and they simply remain on the Caught Pokemon page.
If the user selects yes, then the selected Pokemon will be released and removed from the Caught Pokemon page.
