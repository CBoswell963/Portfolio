PokedexApp Description

When the user open the app, a text box input and a search button appear on the main page of the app.
The user can input either the Pokemon's name or the Pokemon's Id (National Pokedex No.) and then press search.
Upon pressing search, the app will fetch the Pokemon's data from the API database.  It will then use the data to display the Pokemon's sprite, the Pokemon's name and its first type below the search bar.
The process can be repeated as long as the app is running, replacing the displayed data each time the operatino is executed.
